/**
 * Suppose that in Section 4.2.2, “The equals Method,” on p. 140, the Item.equals method uses an instanceof test.
 * Implement DiscountedItem.equals so that it compares only the superclass if otherObject is an Item,
 * but also includes the discount if it is a DiscountedItem.
 * Show that this method preserves symmetry but fails to be transitive — that is,
 * find a combination of items and discounted items so that x.equals(y) and y.equals(z), but not x.equals(z).
