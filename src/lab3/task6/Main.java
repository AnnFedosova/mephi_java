/**
 *  In this exercise, you will try out what happens when a method is added to an interface.
 *  In Java 7, implement a class DigitSequence that implements Iterator<Integer>, not IntSequence.
 *  Provide methods hasNext, next, and a do-nothing remove.
 *  Write a program that prints the elements of an instance.
 *  In Java 8, the Iterator class gained another method, forEachRemaining.
 *  Does your code still compile when you switch to Java 8?
 *  If you put your Java 7 class in a JAR file and donâ€™t recompile, does it work in Java 8?
 *  What if you call the forEachRemaining method?
 *  Also, the remove method has become a default method in Java 8, throwing an UnsupportedOperationException.
 *  What happens when remove is called on an instance of your class?
